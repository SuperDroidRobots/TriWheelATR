# TriWheelATR
The example code in this repository provide basic demonstrations of functions and to provide a base for your next project. These are written specifically for our IG32 Triangular Vectoring Robot Platform ([TP-251-003](http://www.superdroidrobots.com/shop/item.aspx/programmable-triangular-omni-wheel-vectoring-robot-ig32-dm/1486/ "Programmable Triangular Omni Wheel Vectoring Robot - IG32 DM") ).

If you have requests for additional code samples, please send them to info (at) SDRobots.com

## Motor Demo
Demonstrates motor movement by ramping the motors up and down in each direction. This is the demonstration code that is pre-programmed on all assembled platforms.

## xBee Demo
Builds on the motor demo example and combines it with our xBee Remote system ([TE-900-004](http://www.superdroidrobots.com/shop/item.aspx/programmable-xbee-control-interface-package/1727/ "xBee Wireless Joystick")) for wireless joystick control. 

# External Library Dependencies
None. This platform uses our LMD18200 motor controllers ([TE-058-000](http://www.superdroidrobots.com/shop/item.aspx/pwm-motor-controller-3a-12-55v/583/ "LMD18200 Motor Controller")) which accept a PWM and a digital input to set the speed and direction.
